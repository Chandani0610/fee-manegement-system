# fee management system

This project is a fee management system website designed to streamline and organize student fee transactions. Students can view their individual fee structure and choose to pay either online or offline. Online payments generate an instant receipt, while offline payments trigger a token generation system that assigns a specific date and time—within 7 days—for payment at the college counter. During this period, students receive timely reminders through email notifications to ensure dues are cleared on time. Once the payment is completed, the system automatically updates the fee status
